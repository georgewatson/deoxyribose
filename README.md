# Deoxyribose
The DNA-themed programming language all the kids are talking about

## Introducing Deoxyribose

Deoxyribose is a stack-based esoteric programming language based on the syntax
and function of DNA.

A valid deoxyribose program is made up entirely of the letters A, C, G, and T,
which form three-digit **codons** in accordance with the
[DNA codon table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_codon_table).
These codons correspond to stack or flow-control operations. All other
characters are ignored, making the language suitable for polyglots and other
such fun things.

Interestingly, the correspondence between codons and operations is
**degenerate**, so there's more than one way to write each operator, just like
in the real genetic code.

Execution of Deoxyribose takes place on a closed circle of DNA (like the
bacterial genome).
Any amount of information can be placed before the first start codon, and if no
stop codon is found, execution will loop around to the very beginning.
Clever use of the frameshifts this can lead to, combined with the degeneracy of
the codon–amino acid correspondence, can allow some very fun and exciting
things.

The name of the language was selected due to being the "most-DNA-y" word that
doesn't contain an A, C, G, or T, meaning it can be included in a comment or
shebang (`#! /usr/bin/env deoxyribose` is a valid comment).

## Amino acids (operators)

The operators are defined by their correspondence to particular amino acids, as
follows.

### Special codons
* **Start** (`ATG`): Start program execution
* **Stop** (`TAG`, `TAA`, and `TGA`): *End* program execution & return 0

### Charged amino acids — Single-stack operations
* **His**: *Push* next codon (expressed in quaternary notation, see below) to
  the top of the main stack
* **Lys**: *Pop* top of main stack to standard output as a number
* **Arg**: *Pop* top of main stack to standard output as a Unicode character
* **Glu**: *Dupe* (duplicate) the top element of the main stack
* **Asp**: *Drop* the top element of the main stack

### Non-polar amino acids — Two-stack operations
* **Leu**: *Plus* (add) the top elements of the main and auxiliary stacks,
  remove these elements, and place the result on top of the main stack
* **Ile**: *Minus* (subtract) the top element of the auxiliary stack from the
  top element of the main stack, remove these elements, and place the result on
  top of the main stack
* **Val**: *Mul* (multiply) the top elements of the main and auxiliary stacks,
  remove these elements, and place the result on top of the main stack
* **Pro**: *Divide* the top element of the main stack by the top element
  of the auxiliary stack, round the result towards zero, remove these elements,
  and place the result on top of the main stack
* **Met**: *Swop* (swap) the top elements of the main and auxiliary stacks
* **Phe**: *Join* (concatenate) the main and auxiliary stacks by placing the
  auxiliary stack on top of the main stack, leaving the auxiliary stack empty
* **Gly**: *Move* the top element of the main stack to the top of the auxiliary
  stack
* **Trp**: *Power* (exponentiate) the top element of the main stack to the power
  of the top element of the auxiliary stack, remove these elements, and place
  the result on top of the main stack
* **Ala**: *Modulo* — calculate the remainder when the top element of the main
  stack is divided by the top element of the auxiliary stack, remove both of
  these elements, and place the result on top of the main stack

### Polar amino acids — Flow control
* **Cys**: *Jump* – Jump to the *next* occurrence of the next codon
* **Asn**: *Loop* – Jump backwards to the *previous* occurrence of the next
  codon
* **Ser**: *Jump if <=0* – If the top element of the main stack is less than or
  equal to zero, jump to the *next* occurrence of the next codon
* **Thr**: *Loop if <=0* – If the top element of the main stack is less than or
  equal to zero, jump to the *previous* occurrence of the next codon
* **Tyr**: *Jump if null* – If the main stack is empty, jump to the *next*
  occurrence of the next codon
* **Gln**: *Loop if null* – If the main stack is empty, jump to the *previous*
  occurrence of the next codon

Note that the length of these jumps need not always be a multiple of three. This
can cause frameshifts, which are half the fun.

## Integer literals

Integer literals are expressed as a three-digit number in base-4, such that
`A` = 0, `C` = 1, `G` = 2, and `T` = 3. This limits integer literals to the
range `AAA` (0) to `TTT` (63).

Once stored inside the stack, values are not subject to these same limits, and
are treated just like ordinary Python numbers. Larger values, floats, and
negative numbers can therefore be constructed using mathematical operations.

Unicode characters can be stored as their character reference and converted back
by arginine. There is no built-in string (or array) datatype, nor any real
distinction between ints and floats, only numbers ordered on the stack.

## Examples

Note that the examples below include spaces to separate segments of the code for
readability; these are unnecessary, ignored by the interpreter, and excluded
from the given byte counts.

The multi-line explanations given below each example will not run as expected
unless all A, C, G, and T characters (case-insensitive) are removed from the
comments; all other comment characters are fine.

These examples generally implement a naïve and accessible approach to a problem,
in order to demonstrate the power and concept of programming in Deoxyribose.
These solutions may be suboptimal in terms of performance and byte count.
Golfing them down is left as an exercise to the reader (but the reader is
encouraged to submit shorter solutions as pull requests).

### Hello, world!

`ATG CATGAC CACTTTCACGCCGGTTTA ... CATTTTCATAGCGGTTTG AGATATATTAATTTG`
(Truncated because it's long and boring, actually prints `Hd!`)

### Infinite Fibonacci sequence

`ATG CATAACGAA GGT GAATTAGGCATGGAAAAAAATGGT` (39 B)

Accepts no input; prints an infinite series of newline-separated integers to
STDOUT. The printed sequence starts at 2, but it would be trivial to add the
expected `1\n1\n` at the expense of a few more bytes.

### Cat

`ATG GGTTATTGTAATATGT TTT AGATATTCTAATTTTCTTA` (41 B)

Accepts any number of characters or Unicode codepoints as arguments; prints its
input to the screen.
If the input contains spaces, these will be stripped unless the string is
wrapped in quotes.
Input containing numbers is fine, but entirely numeric input will be converted
into the corresponding Unicode character (e.g. input of `100` prints `d`).

### Truth machine

`ATG GAG AAG AGC ATA AAT` (18 B)

Accepts one value as input. If this value is less than or equal to 0, it is
printed once before the program terminates. If the value is greater than 0, it
is printed infinitely.

```
ATG                         ATA
GAG Glu     Dupe            TGG Trp     Power
AAG Lys     Pop             AGA Arg     Unipop
AGC Ser     Jump if <= 0    AGA Arg     Unipop
ATA "                       GCA Ala     Modulo
AAT Asn     Loop            TAA End
```

* Execution starts at the initial ATG.
* The top element of the main stack is duplicated & printed, then
    * If the value is less than or equal to zero, jump to the ATA formed by the
      Asn and the start codon (remember, the code is circular), then run
      through a series of no-ops, including printing some non-printable
      characters.
    * If the value is greater than 0, loop back to the start.

If you don't like the ugly sequence of no-ops, adding `ATG` to the end to make
the loop target explicit results in a clean termination immediately after the
jump, for three more bytes.

## Note

This is very much a work in progress, and some aspects of the design will
probably be changed in backwards-incompatible ways in future versions. I would
welcome suggestions.
