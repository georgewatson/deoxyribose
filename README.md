# Deoxyribose
The DNA-themed programming language all the kids are talking about

## Introducing Deoxyribose

Deoxyribose is a stack-based esoteric programming language based on the syntax
and function of DNA.

A valid deoxyribose program is made up entirely of the letters A, C, G, and T,
which form three-digit **codons** in accordance with the
[DNA codon table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_codon_table).
These codons correspond to stack or flow-control operations. All other
characters are ignored, making the language suitable for polyglots and other
such fun things.

Interestingly, the correspondence between codons and operations is
**degenerate**, so there's more than one way to write each operator, just like
in the real genetic code.

Execution of Deoxyribose takes place on a closed circle of DNA (like the
bacterial genome).
Any amount of information can be placed before the first start codon, and if no
stop codon is found, execution will loop around to the very beginning.
Clever use of the frameshifts this can lead to, combined with the degeneracy of
the codon–amino acid correspondence, can allow some very fun and exciting things.

## Amino acids (operators)

The operators are defined by their correspondence to particular amino acids, as
follows.

### Special codons
* `ATG`: Start program execution. Everything before this codon is ignored, and
  it is expected that the next codon will define the "block size" (see below);
  this codon also codes for methionine
* `TAG`, `TAA`, and `TGA`: Stop; exit the program and return 0.

### Charged amino acids — Single-stack operations
* **His**: Push next block (expressed in quaternary notation, see below) to the
  top of the main stack
* **Lys**: Pop top of main stack to standard output as an integer
* **Arg**: Pop top of main stack to standard output as a Unicode character
* **Glu**: Duplicate top element of main stack
* **Asp**: Drop the top element of the main stack

### Non-polar amino acids — Two-stack operations
* **Leu**: Add the top elements of the main and auxiliary stack, remove these
  elements, and place the result on top of the main stack
* **Ile**: Subtract the top element of the auxiliary stack from the top element
  of the main stack, remove these elements, and place the result on top of the
  main stack
* **Val**: Multiply the top elements of the main and auxiliary stack, remove these
  elements, and place the result on top of the main stack
* **Pro**: Divide the top element of the main stack by the top element
  of the auxiliary stack, round the result towards zero, remove these elements,
  and place the result on top of the main stack
* **Met**: Swap the top elements of the main and auxiliary stacks
* **Phe**: Put the auxiliary stack on top of the main stack, clearing the
  auxiliary stack
* **Gly**: Move the top element of the main stack to the top of the auxiliary
  stack
* ~~**Ala**: Calculate the top element of the main stack modulo the top element
  of the auxiliary stack, remove these elements, and place the result on top of the
  main stack~~ (*deprecated; likely to be removed in future versions; use of Pro
  and Ile to replicate functionality is recommended*)

### Polar amino acids — Flow control
* **Ser**: If the top element of the main stack is less than or equal to zero,
  jump to the next **Thr**
* **Tyr**: If the main stack is empty, jump to the next **Gln**
* **Asn**: Jump backwards to the previous **Cys**

Note that the length of these jumps need not always be a multiple of three. This
can cause frameshifts, which are half the fun.

## Integer literals

"But," I hear you cry, "How am I supposed to represent numbers using only the
letters A, C, G, and T?"

"Simple," I reply. "You just express natural numbers in base-4 such that A = 0,
C = 1, G = 2, and T = 3."

This is also where the block size comes in. The block size is a 3-digit base-4
number, expressed as described above, that specifies how many codons are in a
block. For example, a block size of `AAC` allows numbers up to `4**3 - 1` (63) to be
represented as integer literals, `AAG` up to `4**6 - 1` (4095), and `TTT` up
to `4**189 - 1` (~6E113). But choosing a larger block size means typing more
every time you want a number, so choose the balance carefully.

Once stored inside the stack, values are not subject to these same limits, and
are treated just like ordinary Python integers (which can't handle numbers as
large as the notation described above theoretically supports; this is a
shortcoming of the current implementation of the interpreter, not the language).
Negative integers can therefore be constructed by subtracting a natural number
from zero.

Unicode characters can be stored as their character reference, and converted
back by arginine. There is no built-in string datatype, only chars ordered on
the stack.

`ATGAAC TCT TGTGAAAAAAAT ACTTAG`
(27 B)
```
ATG Start
AAC Block size = 1

TCT Ser     If top element of main stack is <= 0, jump to Thr

TGT Cys     Destination of Asn
GAA Glu     Duplicate top block of main stack
AAA Lys     Pop top block of main stack as int

Note that the code
`ATGAAC TCT TGTCATAACAAAAAT ACTTAG`
(30 B)
```
ATG Start
AAC Block size = 1

TCT Ser     If top element of main stack is <= 0, jump to Thr

TGT Cys     Destination of Asn
CAT His     Push next block to main stack
AAC 1
AAA Lys     Pop top block of main stack as int
AAT Asn     Jump back to Cys

ACT Thr     Destination of Ser
TAG Stop
```
does not work as expected, outputting a single `0` before terminating.

This is because the `ACA` formed by the numeric literal 1 and
the following Lys is recognised as the destination of the Ser → Thr jump, then
the frame-shifted `AAA` immediately following is interpreted as a Lysine; the code
then runs through a series of other operations (Ile, Leu, Arg) before looping
back to the start and terminating on the `TGA` formed by the start and block
size codons.

## Notes etc.

This is very much a work in progress, and there are some very poor aspects of the
design that will likely be changed in backwards-incompatible ways in future
versions. I would welcome suggestions.
